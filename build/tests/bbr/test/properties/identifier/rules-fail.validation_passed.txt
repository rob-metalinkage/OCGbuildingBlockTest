** Validation error **
Validation result for _sources/properties/identifier/rules.shacl:
  Validation Report
  Conforms: False
  Results (1):
  Constraint Violation in OrConstraintComponent (http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#OrConstraintComponent):
  	Severity: sh:Violation
  	Source Shape: cdifd:CDIFIdentifierShape
  	Focus Node: [ rdf:type schema:PropertyValue ; schema:propertyID Literal("CtYO") ; schema:url Literal("vX") ]
  	Value Node: [ rdf:type schema:PropertyValue ; schema:propertyID Literal("CtYO") ; schema:url Literal("vX") ]
  	Message: Tricky, needs work; CDIF uses schema.org/PropertyValue both in the context of an identifier, and in the context of variableMeasured; the rules are slightly different-- for variableMeasured want a name, for identifier want a value. to an identifier must provide either a value or a url. The value can be either a full URI or identifier token part of URI if a url is provided. url value must be a resolvable URL that provides a description of the identified resource.
